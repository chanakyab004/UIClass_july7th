1.Use of JavaScript
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

>>> The main purpose of JavaScript is to make things happen in the user browser itself without sending to the server.

>>> We can validate field by field rather than waiting until user has completely filled out the screen and click the submit button.
>>> Javascript adds behaviour to the web page where it is capable of responding to actions by your visitors without needing to load a new page.

>>>Javascript code is less and it works more.

>>> JavaScript saves time,you need not code all the pages in html we can reuse the html and Dhtml code by writing javaScript code.


2.DOM Manipulation:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

DOM: DOM is a document Object Model is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

Dom manipulations change the attributes of an element,sets elements style properties, modifies entire elements, these all refers to as setters as they change the values of properties.

3.Events in javascript:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

there are many events in javascripts
they are
onsubmit:
this event triggers when a form is submitted.
onchange:
to change the html element we use onchange event.

onclick
to perform some operation,when a user clicks the particular html element.

onmouseover
to perform some action when a user moves over an html element.

onmouseout
to perform some action when a user moves away from an html elemnent.

onkeydown
to perform an action when a keyboard key is pressed.

onload
this event triggers when document is loaded.

onblur:
this event triggers when window loses focus.

oncontextmenu:
this is event triggers when user calls the context menu by right clicking.

onselect:
this event triggers when an element is selected.

onsuspend:
this event is triggered when the browser fetching media data but stopped before it is completely loaded into the browser.

onscroll:
this event is triggered when scrollbar is being sscrolled in a page.

onresize:
this event triggers when window is resized.

onfocus:
this event triggers when window is focused.

onstorage:
this event triggers when a document loads

4.JAvaScript DataTypes:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
there are 2 different datatypes in javascript:
1.primitive datatypes
2.Non primitive datatypes


1.primitive data types
Boolean
== Boolean represents values either true or false.

Undefined
== Undefined represents undefined value.

Number
== Number represents numerical values.

String:
== String represents sequence of character elements

Null
== represents NUll value.

Non-primitive data types:
Object:
== represents an instance through which we can access members.
Array:
== Array represents group of homogenous elements.

function
== return a value when it is called by any element.

6.Difference between Null and Undefined:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Null is an assigned value to a variable to represent no value to the variable. Null is defined to a variable as an empty value intentionally.Null is an object

Undefined is declared to a variable but not assigned any value.It is a type by default.


5.Conditions and Loops:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Loops:
========

there are different loops in javascript,

>> we use loops when we want to run the same code again and again by different possibilities.

1.for loop:
=============

>> in for loop we can declare a variable,initialize a variable,and increment them.
>>we can write the logic within the for loop and it executes until the specific condition is satisfied.

2.for in loop:
===============

>> we can acquire properties of specific group or an object elements in to the loop and execute for elements in the given object.

3.while Loop
===============
>>while loop executes the code until the condition is true.

4.Do while Loop
================
>>Do while loop executes the block of code before checking the condition and it stops until the condition is true.

Conditions in javascript:
================================

1.if else
In if else, if block executes iff if condition is true and if-condition is false then it executes the else block.

2.else if
If we want to execute multiple if conditions we use else-if statements.
if one condition fails then it checks the else-if statement and if that statement too is false then it executes else block.

3.switch
 switch case selects one among many cases,in this we pass an expression and it compares this expression with every case and executes the result.
