1.what is prototype in object
2.what is constructor? and new key word? why do we use it?
3. instanceof in javascript
4. this key word ?



1.
Prototype:
>>>>>>>>>>>
>>Every JavaScript object has a prototype. The prototype is also an object.

>>All JavaScript objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype.

>>Object.prototype is the super of all prototypes.

>>we can create prototype of an object using a constructor.

>>we can also create a prototype of an  using this keyword
>>we can add new property using the prototype to existing function using

functionName.prototype.propertyName ="value";

2.constructor:
we can instantiate an object using constructor.
there are two types of constructors they are :
1. native constructor
2.custom constructor

1.native constructors are which available automatically in the runtime execution like Array and Object.

2.custom constructor are which defined by the user itself and in which the properties and methods are defined by the user.

new keyword:
>>>>>>>>>>>
new keyword is used to create an object

syntax:
new constructor[([arguments])]

3. instanceof
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

it checks whether the object is created by a given constructor
it checks the current object and returns true if the object is of the specified object type.

4.this keyword:

this keyword can be used in two contexts
1.global context
2.function context

1. Global context
in global context it refers to the global object.

2.Function context:
In function context this refers based on the function values.
